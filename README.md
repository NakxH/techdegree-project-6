# Techdegree-Project-6

This is my sixth Treehouse Techdegree Project

## About this project

In this project I have created my own portfolio using Express.

## Style Changes made

I added my own color scheme to the project rather than the provided color scheme. I have also changed the navigation bar color for the mobile view to match the color scheme of the rest of the portfolio.

## How to run this project
- Clone the repository.
- Run the `npm start` command to start the express app.
